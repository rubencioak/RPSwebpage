<p class="abstract-text" style="display:none; font-size:.90em">Does free riding in collective bargaining systems introduce inefficiencies in the labour  market?
							What  are  the  welfare  losses  if  at  all?   What  would  the  optimal bargaining protocol be?
							Participants of the political process in collective agreements set the institutions that fit them best,
							non-participants free ride on what is agreed. Building on previous research, I analyse how
							participants set one institution, minimum wages, in a model of two-sided heterogeneity with
							on-the-jobsearch. I take the model to data using the Spanish employer-employee database 
							‘Muestra Continua de Vidas Laborales’, and the model is estimated by the Method of Simulated Moments. 
							Workers in large firms use Minimum wages to increase the value of their jobs whereas firms avoid competitors. 
							I show that the effects are more unemployment among low-skill workers and increase in wages for 
							those who stay employed, reducing overall welfare.  Carrying a counterfactual analysis, I found 
							that increasing the base of participants in the political process raises welfare and reduces 
							unemployment, at a cost of employed earning less</p>

<li> <p> <b>Unemployment Effects of Stay-at-Home Orders: Evidence from High Frequency Claims Data</b>
<br /> 
 with Chaewon Baek, Peter McCrory, and Preston Mui. 
Published   in <i> The Review of Economics and Statistics (Recently Accepted)</i> <i></i> .  <a href="assets/papers/Unemployment-Effects-of-Stay-at-Home-Orders.pdf"> (link) </a> 

|  <span id="abstract-link" class="abstract-click">Abstract</span>
    <p class="abstract-text" style="display:none; font-size:.90em">Without effective mitigation strategies, epidemiological models project that upwards of 2 million Americans are at risk of death from the coronavirus pandemic, with many more subject to uncertain health complications. Heeding the warning, in mid-March 2020, state and local officials in the United States began issuing Stay-at-Home (SAH) orders, instructing people to remain at home except to do essential tasks or to do work deemed essential. By April 4th, 2020, nearly 95% of the U.S. population was under such directives. Over the same three week period, initial claims for unemployment spiked to unprecedented levels. In this paper, we use the high-frequency, decentralized implementation of SAH policies, along with high-frequency unemployment insurance (UI) claims, to disentangle the local effect of SAH policies from the general economic disruption wrought by the pandemic that affected all regions similarly. We find that, all else equal, each employment-weighted week of Stay-at-Home exposure increased a state’s weekly initial UI claims by 1.9% of its employment level. Ignoring cross-regional spillovers, this finding implies that, of the 16 million UI claims made between March 14, 2020 and April 4, 2020, only 4 million are attributable to the Stay-at-Home directives. This evidence suggests that the direct effect of SAH orders accounted for a significant, but minority share of the overall rise in unemployment claims, and that the majority of the rise in unemployment during this period would have occurred in the absence of these orders. This suggests that any economic recovery that arises from undoing SAH orders will be limited if the underlying pandemic is not resolved.</p>

<li> <p> <b>Firm Entry and Macroeconomic Dynamics: A State-Level Analysis</b>
<br /> 
 with Francois Gourio and Michael Siemer. 
Published May 2016 in <i> American Economic Review</i> <i>Papers and Proceedings</i>  106 (5), pp. 214-218.  <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20161052"> (link) </a>

    <p class="abstract-text" style="display:none; font-size:.90em">Using an annual panel of US states over the period 1982-2014, we estimate the response of macroeconomic variables to a shock to the number of new firms (startups). We find that these shocks have significant effects that persist for many years on real GDP, productivity, and population. This is consistent with simple models of firm dynamics where a "missing generation" of firms affects productivity persistently.</p>

<li> <p> <b>Fiscal Consequences of Paying Interest on Reserves</b>
<br /> 
 with Marco Bassetto. 
Published December 2013 in <i> Fiscal Studies</i> <i></i>  34 (4), pp. 413-436.  <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1475-5890.2013.12014.x"> (link) </a> 

|  <span id="abstract-link" class="abstract-click">Abstract</span>
    <p class="abstract-text" style="display:none; font-size:.90em">We review the role of the central bank's balance sheet in a textbook monetary model and explore what changes if the central bank is allowed to pay interest on its liabilities. When the central bank (CB) cannot pay interest, away from the zero lower bound its (real) balance sheet is limited by the demand for money. Furthermore, if securities are not marked to market and the central bank holds its bonds to maturity, it is impossible for the CB to make losses, and it always obtains profits from being a monopoly provider of money. When the option of paying interest on liabilities is allowed, the limit on the CB's balance sheet is lifted. In this case, the CB is free to take on interest‐rate risk – for example, by buying long‐term securities and financing those purchases with short‐term debt that pays the market interest rate. This is a risky enterprise that can lead to additional profits but also to losses. To the extent that losses exceed the profits of the monopoly operations, the CB faces two options - either it is recapitalised by Treasury or it increases its monopoly profits by raising the inflation tax.</p>

<li> <p> <b>Forecasting inflation and the Great Recession</b>
<br /> 
 with Marco Bassetto and Christine Ostrowski. 
Published September 2013 in <i> Economic Perspectives</i> <i></i>  37 (Q3), pp. 79-106.  <a href="http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/economic_perspectives/2013/3Q2013_part1_bassetto_messer_ostrowski.pdf"> (link) </a>

    <p class="abstract-text" style="display:none; font-size:.90em">This article shows how the recovery of inflation in 2009-10 occurred precisely at the only time (since 1985) the models would predict disinflation, i.e., inflation went up when the models said it should go down.</p>
